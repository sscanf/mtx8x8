I carried out this project in the late 90s.

This is the firmware of an 8x8 channel audio and video matrix.

It has a control panel to be manipulated directly from the device and an application to be controlled from a Windows PC.

The firmware is written in assembler for the MC68HC75C8/A microcontroller.

The application is developed in Microsft C (MFC).
